👋 Hi, I’m Felix Hahn,

I am developping modules for HumHub like
- the free [Dark Mode](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/dark-mode/description) module with more than 700 installations
- the [SEO](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/seo/description) module and
- the [Verified](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/verified/description) module which I am developping collaboratively with GreenMeteor.

🌱 My first published repository is a [child theme](https://github.com/felixhahnweilheim/humhub-themes-orange) for Humhub.
