👋 Hi, I’m Felix Hahn,

I am developping modules for HumHub like
- the free [Dark Mode](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/dark-mode/description) module with more than 1700 installations,
- the [SEO](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/seo/description) module and
- the [E-Mail to Post](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/email-post/description) module.

🌱 My first published repository was a [child theme](https://github.com/felixhahnweilheim/humhub-themes-orange) for Humhub. But with the latest update (HumHub 1.18) you might not need a custom theme anymore. You can now set the most important colors in the administration interface. Alternatively I'd recommend the Clean Theme.
